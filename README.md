# gcode-studio
HTML5 G-Code transformer with visualization.

## G-Code studio will not fix your prints. Its goal is to break them.

Many people have put a lot of effort into ensuring that slicers convert 3D geometry into machine instructions (G-Code) that prints accurately and reliably. Gcode Studio allows you to take that G-Code and transform it in ways that almost certainly will end in ruin. If you are thoughtful and careful this might be an interesting ruin of your print. If you are not thoughtful or careful, it may be the ruin of your printer. Use at your own risk.
